Greetings!

Welcome to my corner of the internt. One of my many corners in this world wide web.

Who am I? Welllllll see that's kinda complicated. I do a lot: music, photography, curling... But none of that is exactly relevant here.
My projects range from fun and quirky to stupid and complex. You'll find everything from failed experiments to work projects here. It's a truly unfortunate mix.
I mainly do Web Based projects. I'm one of those poor souls who is proficient in the dreaded JavaScript. I've recreated classic games, like UNO (twice) and Picross (only once :c )

Other than quirkly little games with quirkly web based graphics, I have a strong interest in the Ethical implications of Code, how software and technology shape our daily lives, how they affect our decision making, and how they uphold the traditional power structures.
I strongly believe that, as programmers, our decisions matter as much as those made by engineers working on a bridge, a building, or roads, and that we should be held to the 
same moral and ethical standards.
